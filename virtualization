installing of virtualization tools and packages

To install a KVM, you will require at least 6 GB of free disk space, 2 GB of RAM, and an additional core or thread per guest.
Check whether your CPU supports a virtualization flag (such as SVM or VMX)

~]# grep -E 'svm|vmx' /proc/cpuinfo

Check whether the hardware virtualization modules (such as kvm_intel and kvm) are loaded

~]# lsmod | grep kvm

Manual installation

Install the software needed to provide an environment 

~]# yum -y install qemu-kvm qemu-img libvirt

~]# yum -y install virt-install libvirt-python python-virthost libvirt-client

~]# systemctl status libvirtd

~]# systemctl enable libvirtd

We'll use NetworkManager to create a bridge, so don't disable NetworkManager and bridge-utils installed.
